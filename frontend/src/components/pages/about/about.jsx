        <h2>From Global to Local</h2>
        <p>
          What began as a humble burger joint in the U.S. is now a sensation across India. At McDonald’s India,
          we’ve blended international quality with regional flavors — think McAloo Tikki, Masala McEgg, and Maharaja Mac.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in serving food that feels personal. Our chefs draw inspiration from your taste buds — spicy, tangy, and satisfying.
